## Overview

Scout is an first of its kind intuitive, decentralized platform to improve the experience of transferring cryptocurrency. Scout is completely peer to peer meaning contracts never hold custody of user's coins. Anyone can connect to and use Scout without ever having to hand over control of their funds.

Scout has a suite of built in features to improve transparency and security when sending funds. This include a novel public key system where users can set a pin as a second form of verification for users sending crypto to their address. Scout also provides an in-built contact system, as well as messaging and gifs on the blockchain! 

All optional of course for the anons out there ;) 

<b>No kyc or personal information required or collected!<b>

 * Integrates seamelessly with metamask
 * Free to use


## Getting started
1. Clone repo
2. make sure to install vite and hardhat

run the following command
```npm run dev```

additional erc20 tokens can be added through the following process:

  a. find the address of the token on the desired network 
  
    I highly reccomend using uniswaps token lists [https://tokenlists.org/] to find the official addresses
    
    
## Deployment
In the hardhat config file enter your alchemy api key and private key from your wallet



## Useful Libraries
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) -> for frontend tooling

[MUI](https://mui.com/) -> for autocomplete feature

[Notiflix](https://notiflix.github.io/) -> for creating popup notifications and confirmations



## Huge shoutout...
I wanted to thank JSMastery for [this fantastic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn_Kb3MR_cU&list=PLoclJQ4TxDnBgL_WQmYpN7OcIAiYRkJCt&index=4) that has provided some of the css and basic functionality that is the backbone of Scout. However, I believe I went above and beyond to turn a simple application into a innovative tool with a multitude of features. With that being said... I'd love for you to clone this repo and make improvements! There is so much more you can add. Further developments can include expanding to other EVM networks and implementing more erc20 tokens (see above). 

I hope somewhere out there this project makes a difference. Whether it is saving you from a hack or inspiring you to modify my design, I hope that Scout shows you a way forward towards a better world...
